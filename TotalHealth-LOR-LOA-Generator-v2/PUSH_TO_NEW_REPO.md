# 🚀 Push to New GitHub Repository

## ✅ FRESH START READY!

I've created a **completely clean repository** with ONLY your v2 code.

**Location**: `/home/user/TotalHealth-LOR-LOA-Generator-v2/`

**What's included:**
- ✅ All v2 code (32 files)
- ✅ Clean git history (1 commit, no baggage)
- ✅ All documentation
- ✅ Tests (15 passing)
- ✅ .gitignore (protecting secrets)
- ✅ Ready to push to new GitHub repo

**What's NOT included:**
- ❌ No old v1 code
- ❌ No commit history from old repo
- ❌ No secrets.toml (protected by .gitignore)
- ❌ Completely fresh start

## 📋 Step-by-Step: Create New GitHub Repository

### Step 1: Create New Repository on GitHub

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click the **"+"** button (top right) → **"New repository"**
3. **Repository name**: `TotalHealth-LOR-LOA-Generator`
4. **Description**: `Professional LOR/LOA document generator for Total Health Conferencing`
5. **Visibility**:
   - ✅ **Private** (recommended - keeps your business code confidential)
   - OR Public (if you want to share)
6. **DO NOT** initialize with:
   - ❌ README (we already have one)
   - ❌ .gitignore (we already have one)
   - ❌ License (add later if needed)
7. Click **"Create repository"**

### Step 2: Copy the Repository URL

GitHub will show you a page with commands. Copy the **HTTPS URL**:

```
https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/TotalHealth-LOR-LOA-Generator.git
```

### Step 3: Push Your Code

Run these commands:

```bash
cd /home/user/TotalHealth-LOR-LOA-Generator-v2

# Add your GitHub repo as remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/TotalHealth-LOR-LOA-Generator.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

**That's it!** Your fresh, clean code is now on GitHub with no history.

## 🎯 What Happens Next

### Your New Repo Will Have:
- ✅ Clean commit history (1 commit)
- ✅ Professional v2 code only
- ✅ All documentation
- ✅ Tests passing
- ✅ Ready for Streamlit Cloud deployment

### Your Old Repo:
- ✅ Still exists unchanged
- ✅ v1 app still running
- ✅ Complete backup of everything

---

## 📦 Deploy to Streamlit Cloud

Once pushed to GitHub:

1. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
2. Sign in with GitHub
3. Click **"New app"**
4. **Repository**: Select `TotalHealth-LOR-LOA-Generator`
5. **Branch**: `main`
6. **Main file path**: `app.py` (just `app.py`, not `v2/app.py` - we're already in the clean repo!)
7. **Advanced settings** → **Secrets**: Copy contents from `.streamlit/secrets.toml.template`
8. Click **"Deploy!"**

---

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Secrets Management

**IMPORTANT**: Your `.streamlit/secrets.toml` is NOT in git (protected by .gitignore).

When deploying to Streamlit Cloud, you'll need to manually add secrets:

1. Use the template: `.streamlit/secrets.toml.template`
2. Fill in YOUR actual values:
   - Passwords (main, Sarah, Allison)
   - Booth pricing
   - Add-ons pricing
3. Paste into Streamlit Cloud secrets section

**Never commit secrets.toml to git!**

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### "Permission denied" when pushing

**Solution**:
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Use personal access token instead of password
- Or use SSH: `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:YOUR-USERNAME/TotalHealth-LOR-LOA-Generator.git`

### "Repository not found"

**Solution**:
- Double-check the repository URL
- Make sure the repository was created successfully
- Verify you have access to the repository

### "Secrets not working in Streamlit Cloud"

**Solution**:
- Ensure no syntax errors in secrets TOML
- Check all brackets and quotes match
- Restart the app after changing secrets
